# Book Store REST Test

Unit Tests for the Book Store API

## About

The [Book Store](https://github.com/kartoffelquadrat/BookStoreInternals) is a test project for service RESTification.  
RESTification success can be measured by comparing the actual API behaviour to the interface specification.

 * This repository hosts unit tests for a systematic evaluation of the REST API correctness.
 * Every Resource+CRUD combination is covered by a dedicated test.
 * Running this test bundle tells you the correctness ratio of a given Book Store REST implementation.

## Usage

 * Clone this repo
 * Open it with IntelliJ
 * Run the tests, verify the success rate:
